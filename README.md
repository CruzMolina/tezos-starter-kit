## What is the tezos-starter-kit?

The Tezos starter kit provides a *truffle box* with reasonable defaults to kick start your smart contract development experience. It includes a ready to use archive sandbox node with RPC & CORS configured.

## Dependencies

- **Docker** - used to run a local Tezos node together with the LIGO compiler (If you're on linux, follow the post-installation steps as well)
- **Node.js** - Javascript runtime environment that we'll use for testing and deployment
- **truffle@alphaTez** - Testing framework, originally built for Ethereum that now includes experimental support for Tezos. It can be installed by running:
```
npm i -g truffle@alphaTez
```

## Getting started

**Unbox the starter kit & install the dependencies**
```shell
$ truffle unbox stove-labs/tezos-starter-kit
$ cd tezos-starter-kit
$ npm i
```

**Compile the example contract**
```shell
$ truffle compile
```

**Start the local sandbox node**
```shell
$ npm run start-sandbox
```

**Migrate the compiled contracts**
```shell
$ truffle migrate
```

**Run the contract tests**
```shell
$ truffle test
```

## Sandbox management

Archive mode sandbox Tezos node is provided within this box with RPC exposed at port `8732` and with two accounts that are generously funded.

#### Commands

```shell
$ npm run start-sandbox
$ npm run kill-sandbox
$ npm run restart-sandbox
```

## Usage with Babylonnet

In order to use your migration scripts with a different network than your local sandbox, you can specify an optional `--network` argument.

Make sure to [claim a new account at the faucet](https://faucet.tzalpha.net), and replace the `faucet.json` file with the new one downloaded previously.
```shell
$ truffle migrate --network babylonnet
```
